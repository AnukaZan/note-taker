# Express.js Note Taker
![Sample Website](image.png)

## Purpose

For this challenge, I created a Note Taker application for writing and saving notes.
The app uses an Express.js back end and will both GET and POST notes generated by users.

As the front end was already created, I handled the back-end and connected the two. Afterwards, I deployed the finished application to Heroku.

## Tools Used
 * Heroku
 * Insomnia
 * Node
 * Express
